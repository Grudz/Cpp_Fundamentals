# Learning_Cplusplus

I have to learn C++ for an autonomous vehicle course before winter semester, 2020, of university. I am documenting this journey with the goal of quantifying my knowledge and developing my C++ skills with the GitHub community. Moreover, I plan to post my projects, past and in the future, on GitHub and encourage others to do the same!
