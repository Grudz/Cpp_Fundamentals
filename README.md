# Learning_Cplusplus

I have to learn C++ for an autonomous vehicle course before winter semester, 2020, of university. I am documenting this journey with the goal of quantifying my knowledge and developing my C++ skills with the GitHub community. Moreover, I plan to post my projects, past and in the future, on GitHub and encourage others to do the same!

An OVERVIEW of this repository:

A small chunk of code for each section in the chapter – applying the principles in that chapter.

A personal project – This project will develop and evolve. The knowledge from ALL the previous sections will be applied to this project until it contains principles from basically every concept embedded in C++.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FORMAT of this repository:

  The Personal Projects are Highlighted and labeled,
  Naming convention => Chapter Name_Section#.cpp
  
CHAPTER 1: Basics of C++ (Only this chapter isn't named correctly)

  Variables and Types.cpp, Constants.cpp, Operators.cpp, Basic Input-Output.cpp
  
    Chapter 1 Project: Basics of C++ Project.cpp

CHAPTER 2: Program Structure
  
   Statements and Flow Control 2_1.cpp, Functions 2_2.cpp, Overloads and Templates 2_3.cpp, Name Visibility 2_4.cpp
   
    Chapter 2 Project: Program Structure Project.cpp
    
CHAPTER 3: Compound Data Types
  
   Arrays 3_1.cpp, Character Sequences 3_2.cpp, Pointers 3_3.cpp, Dynamic Memory 3_4.cpp, Data Structures 3_4.cpp, Input_Output Files.cpp
   
    Chapter 3 Project: Compound Data Types Project.cpp 
    
FINAL CHAPTER
  
   The final project demonstrates the object orientated properties of C++ that distinguishes it from C. Important concepts displayed in this program are inheritance and polymorphism. It demonstrates these concepts in a fun way through a cool mini-game
   
   Supplemental programs: Class Examples.cpp (uses myint.cpp and myint.h) 
   
    Final Project: FINAL PROJECT_Hockey Mini Game.cpp
