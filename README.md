# Learning_Cplusplus

I have to learn C++ for an autonomous vehicle course before winter semester, 2020, of university. I am documenting this journey with the goal of quantifying my knowledge and developing me C++ skills with the Github community.

The format of this repository:

A small chunk of code for each section in the chapter – applying the principles in that chapter.

A personal project – This project will develop and evolve. The knowledge from ALL the previous sections will be applied to this project until it contains principles from basically every concept embedded in C++.
